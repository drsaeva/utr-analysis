# utr-analysis
Script suite written with the original intent of acquiring, analyzing, and storing data from a database of Human 5' UTR sequences (via http://utrdb.ba.itb.cnr.it/)

Later, some scripts were written to parse tumor overexpression data from Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.com/) to compare wth analyzed 5' UTRs to identify potential downstream targets of translational regulation

Scripts present in this repository are provided as-is. This code was some of the first I'd written, and would likely be refactored considerably if I were to re-use it. 

~~Not all scripts are currently present here - please reach out if you would like to see more examples uploaded.~~

Update: All original scripts, aside from kozak_freq.pl (which is in this main directory, have been uploaded to the legacy directory. As described above these are provided as-is.
